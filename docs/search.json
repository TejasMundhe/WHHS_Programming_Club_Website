It uses room-finder,\r\na library we created for using Dijkstra’s algorithm to generate\r\ndirections between rooms in a building.\r\nNo Lab Physics\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWalnut Hills Programming Club’s 2021 showcase project. No Lab Physics allows\r\nstudents and teachers to create their own custom physics labs.\r\nE-Card-Nomics\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDue to a lack of financial literacy in high school curriculum, we\r\nhave noticed that the majority of high school students (including\r\nourselves) do not feel confident in their financial skills going into\r\nadulthood. We hope that E-Card-Nomics will help students\r\nfind a fun and engaging way to learn financial skills that will help\r\nthem in the future. Our project is unique in that it is free, designed\r\nwith high school students in mind, and incorporated game elements in\r\norder to help make the experience more engaging and entertaining for\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
