## Who Are We?
The [Walnut Hills Programming Club](https://github.com/WalnutProgramming), a chapter of [INTERalliance](https://www.interalliance.org/) meets on Tuesday's from 3-4pm in room 3104 to create projects and teach technical skills to students.

  Our club is a way for students to get hands-on programming, organizational, and leadership experience. Students collaborate to write code and create designs for games, websites, and more. Members create and run club events and attend INTERalliance chapter events as well as participate in [programming competitions](events.html).

## Why Join?
We want to get as many Walnut students, grades 7-12, into tech as possible. *No prior coding or design experience is necessary*.

  From complete beginners to more experienced artists and programmers, all club members participate on teams based on their level of experience and area of interest. In addition, Programming Club works to share excitement with the greater Walnut community through workshops and other projects. Our projects like [Walnut.Direct](walnut.direct) aim to positively impact the Walnut community.

## Our School
[Walnut Hills High School](https://walnuthillseagles.com/) is a college preparatory school for students in grades 7-12 in Cincinnati, Ohio. In addition to Programming Club, Walnut offers [computer science and design courses](http://www.walnuthillseagles.com/pdfs/2022-2023_Course_Guide.pdf), all of which are great resources for Walnut students who are interested in these fields.
